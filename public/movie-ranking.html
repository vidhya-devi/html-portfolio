<h1>Favourite Movies of Vidhya</h1>
<h2>My best movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />

<h3>Apocalypto</h3>
<p>This is one of the spine chilling movies out there. I like the tribal setting and the brilliant screen play of the
    movie.</p>

<h3>Animation Movies</h3>
<p>Light hearted movies like Zootopia, Coco, Ratatouille, Wall-E are my favourites. And the Ice Age and Kung Fu Panda
    movie series too.</p>

<h3>Hard Hitting Movies</h3>
<p>Movies like 6 candles, Aramm and Engaeyum Eppothum show cases how life of people turns upside down in a moment. These
    make your heart heavy after watching them.</p>
